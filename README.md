COVID-19 has caused significant disruptions in the daily lives of people around the globe. Consequently, the topic of COVID-19 has been the forefront of most daily news reportings with countless researchers and clinicians dedicated to understanding and treating the disease as well as working to create a vaccine. Not surprisingly, this critical work has generated enormous amounts of data from around the world not only to learn about the disease itself but also to monitor the spread and allow governments to make informed decisions depending on the status of the disease. With this magnitude of available data being made to the general public and the decision makers, the role of data visualization to better understand and discover underlying patterns about the data become especially important because it allows us the data to be more accessible and comprehension to larger number of people. Given the high relevance of the dataset and the impotance of data visualization to communicate with the general public at this current time point, we will use this tutorial to walk through a few interesting graphical concepts that may facilitate this process. Specifically, we'll walk through through how to plot **marginal histograms**, **bubble plots**, and **interactive plots** in R, Stata, Python, and MATLAB.
